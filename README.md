### Demystifying me.. (technically ofcourse)

A _castaway coder_ who just loves to code. Not necesarily good at it, but it's still worth the try.


- ðŸ”­ I'm part of the Core Dev team for [TestNG](https://github.com/cbeust/testng).
- ðŸ”­ I also maintain a few libraries such as 
    - [SimpleSe](https://github.com/RationaleEmotions/SimpleSe) a simplified page objects abstraction for Selenium, 
    - [AutoSpawn](https://github.com/RationaleEmotions/autospawn) a simple automatic browser management integration for selenium using TestNG, 
    - [SimpleSe-CodeGenerator](https://github.com/RationaleEmotions/simplese-codegenerator) a maven plugin that can generate [SimpleSe](https://github.com/RationaleEmotions/SimpleSe) compliant code, 
    - [SimpleSSH](https://github.com/RationaleEmotions/SimpleSSH) a Java abstraction over JSch for programmatic ssh interactions with a unix server, 
    - [Sangrahah](https://github.com/RationaleEmotions/sangrahah) a library that lets you build TestNG suites using annotations (just like how you would do in JUnit)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning *Spring Boot and its fabulous eco-system*
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about - TestNG and Selenium Grid 3
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to define myself as _Always wanted to be a developer, but ended up being a QA._ It took me a while to realise that the best way to be a developer is by being a QA.
